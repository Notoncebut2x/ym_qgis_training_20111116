                    Good Whatever time of day it is! I am so glad you were able to join myself and my co-presenter today!  To start my name is Rory Nealon and I am the activity manager for the YouthMappers program at the US Agency for International Development or USAID, the Federal office in charge of coordinating the United State's assistance to the rest of world.  At USAID I work at the GeoCenter which applies a geographic approach to internatinoal development.  The office helps USAID Missions around the world and Bureaus in DC use geospatial technology for data analysis and visualizations.

			    As you can see from Johannes Vermeer's ~1668 painting titled <i>The Geographer</i>, they used to be painstaking hand drawn documents.  Lucky for you and me, since the 1980s maps have mostly made with the help of computers.

		    <aside class="notes">
		        Maps made on computers are built from different datasets.  This data can be a single point, a collection of polygons, or a photo like recording of color and temperatures.  The map on this slides consists of point vector data for the location of cities, line vector data for the states, and a raster dataset to represent the percentage of days the temperature exceeded 0 or 100 degrees farenheit.

		    <aside class="notes">
                        With data we calculate numbers and make pictures (like a maps!). When calculations are preformed on data we <i>analyze</i> it.  This means we transform the data by doing things like aggregating, summarzing it.  The process of making a picture from data is called <i>symbolization</i> this is when you make decisions on what visual element will represent different parts of the dataset.

                    <aside class="notes">
		        Symbolization and analysis are the two parts needed to make a map.  This training will introduce you to these basic concepts and then have you apply different techniques for symbolization and analysis. But before we do that... why should we even care about  maps in the first place?

	            And I will end the intro section with one of my favorite maps to highlight the point that we need to keep making maps.  This is a map of the Mississippi river, the longest river in America, and this shows how much the course of that river has changed over time.  This is interesting becuase the border between the states of Mississippi and Lousiana are fixed on the boundary of the river, when it changes course it creates small enclaves that the states have to trade back and forth.

		        A good representation of this is taking an orange peel and trying flatten it...you can't without distoring it a lot.  This is true with maps and map projections.  You have to distort the earth's geography to get it to fit onto the 2D plane of a map.  When selecting a project you have to make a compromise between preserving a map's shape and its area...you cannot have both in perfect alignment.

		        Now that we have some basic geographic techniques down, lets get started with some basic GIS concepts.

		        The geographic phenomena we want to map can be <i>discrete</i> or <i>continuous</i>.

		    <aside class="notes">
		        Continous geographic phenomena changes gradually and is not abrupt.  This can be for things like temperature, elevation, water salinity.

		<section>
		    <h3>Discrete types are divided into mutually exclusive parts, with all locations in one part having the same value.</h3>
		    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Sierra_Leone%2C_administrative_divisions_-_de_-_colored_2018.svg/1024px-Sierra_Leone%2C_administrative_divisions_-_de_-_colored_2018.svg.png" style="height:30%; width: 30%;">
		    <aside class="notes">
		        Other types of geographic phenomena are discrete.  This means that they can be divided into distinct parts with everything in the value having the exact same value.  For example country boundaries are discrete as are a building's footprint, or a road.
                    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <h3>Different types of data can be used to represent our geographic phenomenon.</h3>
		    <aside class="notes">
		        To store and symbolize our geographic phenomenon there are different types of data.
		    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <h3>But you have to make sure that the right data is used to represent the right type of phenomenon!!!</h3>
		    <aside class="notes">
		        Matching our data to the right type of phenomenon is crucial.

		    <h3>
		        <ul>
			    <li><b>Nominal Data</b> provides an identifier to discriminate between values.</li>
			    <li><b>Ordinal Data</b> can be put in some natural sequence.</li>
			    <li><b>Interval Data</b> allows for simple forms of computation like + and -.</li>
			    <li><b>Ratio Data</b> allows for most, if not all, arithmetic computations.</li>
			</ul>
		    </h3>
		    <aside class="notes">
		    In general, our data can take four forms:  Nominal which provides an identifier to distinguish different values...an example would be the names of countries to dingish the differen boundaries from one another.  Ordinal data which can be put into a natural sequence  think data that would have high, medium, low associated with it.  Interval data which allows for simple forms of computation like addition and subtraction.  Examples of interval data would be: time, date, temperature, and ph scale.
Finally, ration data which allows for most, if not all, arthmetic computations.  Think of different data that has a number associated with it like population statics broken down by gender or age.

	        <h2>GIS File Types</h2>
		    <aside class="notes">
		        Before I pass the presentation over to Christine, I will talk about how this data is stored.
		    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <h3>Map data is stored as a <i>Vector</i> or a <i>Raster.</i></h3>
		    <aside class="notes">
		        All of the different types of data we just discussed can be stored as a vector or raster file type.  However there is usally one format that is more efficant than the other.
		    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <h3>A raster is a set of regularly spaced cells with associated values.</h3>
                    <h3>The value of the cell is assumed to be valid for all the area within it.</h3>
		    <aside class="notes">
		        A raster is a grid...regularly spaced cells with a value associated with it.  The value of the cell is assumed to be valid for all of the area within it.
		    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <img src="img/raster_example.jpeg">
		    <aside class="notes">
		        In this example you can see the black part of the grid that forms the face is given a value of 1 and the white cells a value of 0. 
		    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <img src="img/oregan_raster.png">
		    <aside class="notes">
		        This is a more complex example where you can see the state of Oregan in the USA and the pixels that make up this raster relate to elevation.
		    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <h3>Vectors, unlike rasters, attempt to explicitly georeference the geographic phenomena.</h3>
		    <aside class="notes">
		        The other type of way data is stored for GIS software are vectors.  Unlike rasters, vectors attempt to explicitly georeference the geographic phenomena they represent.
		    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <h3>They can be a single point (x, y)or(x, y, z).</h3>
		    <img src="img/point_data.jpeg" style="height:65%; width: 65%;">
		    <aside class="notes">
		        Vectors can be a single point (x,y) or with a height (x,y,z)

		    <h3>They can be a line. Which requires two or more nodes and a line drawn between them.</h3>
		    <img src="img/line-vector.png">
		    <aside class="notes">
		       Vectors can also be a line which requires two or more ordered points (also called nodes) with a line drawn between them
		    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <h3>Another type of vectors are polygons. They are a collection of nodes and arcs.</h3>
		    <img src="img/polytong_vector.png">
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Finally, vectors can be polygons.  These are a colletion of nodes with arcs connecting them.  The first and last node are the same point meaning that the it forms a closed shape.
                    </aside>
		</section>

		<section>
		    <h3>Each section of vector data can have thematic data associated with it.</h3>
		    <aside class="notes">
		    Each part of a vector dataset can have different thematic (also called attribute) data associated with it.  It can include nominal data like the name of the feature and ratio data like the area of the feature. And any type of data associated with it.
